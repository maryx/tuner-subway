# Tuner Subway - Guitar/Instrument Tuner in <10kB

![Tuner Subway with JS Enabled](misc/js.png?raw=true "Tuner Subway with JS Enabled")

The top guitar tuner results in the search engines take you to bloated pages with tuners that have tiny little knobs or buttons that are not very user-friendly. Tuner Subway provides a fast and pretty instrument tuner that loads fast and doesn't even need Javascript! What a world!

## Features
- Under 10kB with all assets! Sound files are only loaded on-demand. In other tuners, some sound files are each larger than 10kB!
- Large buttons - you'll never miss them!
- Guitar E tuning works without Javascript!
- Everything you want from the NYC Subway signs!

## MORE Features With Javascript Enabled!
- Under 5kB! For 7 tuners! No better deal out there! :chart_with_upwards_trend:
- Keyboard shortcuts! The numbers on your keyboard can play the notes! :keyboard: :musical_keyboard:
- Super syntheic notes! It's like chiptunes without the tunes!
- Standard E tuning!
- Drop D!
- Drop A#, the `In Flames` classic! :guitar:
- Bass! :fish:
- Banjo!
- Violin!
- Ukulele!
- Cute tuner names!

I used the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) to synthesize the sounds, and Garageband, Audacity, and mp3smaller.com to make the fallback mp3s.
